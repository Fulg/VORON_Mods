This is a super early alpha of this so use at your own risk. It replaces the stock Afterburner "Front Cover" and "Blower Casing" and adds a fan grill that mounts on the stock screw holes using stock screw lengths.

If you wish to add SMD LEDs to the blower casing part, it was designed for the strips that have a density of 144 LEDs/M because that is what I had lying around. It may work with the 60 LEDs per meter density strips as well. There are wire channels around the interior of the parts that should allow for 3 26-28 gauge wires to be routed to drive the LEDs.

Message me on discord if you have any trouble with the wiring and firmware settings for addressable LEDs.

Print orientation.
